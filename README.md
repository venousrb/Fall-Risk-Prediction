# Fall-Risk-Prediction

This is a repository for a fall risk prediction project. I propose a machine learning algorithm that can predict risk of fall with hig sensitivity to what an experienced geriatrician can do. This would eventually enhance the cumbersome and time-consuming process of fall risk screening currently used in clinics to detect older adults at increased risk of fall.


## Overview
This project includes 4 main tasks: data collection and aquisition, statistical analysis, machine learning application, and feature representation. The implemntation Python code, the results and conclusions of each task are disscussed and they are illustrated with some visualization.

- Data Collection


- Machine Learning Application
  - Data Preprocessing
  - 1D Convolutional Neural Network
  - Support Vector Machine

- Feature Representation
  - Time-Frequency Representation
   - 2D Convolutional Neural Network
  - Temporal Gait Features
   - Logistic Regression
